## Hi there 👋

I'm Maame.

I mostly work on backend smart contracts and blockchain-focused projects using Go and Python, especially around privacy, encryption, and decentralized applications. 
I'm exploring how blockchain can be applied to real-world systems, such as healthcare and digital identity.

Most of my work here is focused on learning by doing — small projects, experiments, and practice repositories as I deepen my understanding of backend and blockchain development.
